# Week 5: Trees

Welcome to Week 5 of our DSA Bootcamp! We'll explore hierarchical data structures essential for efficient algorithms and real-world applications.

## Topics Covered

**Binary Trees**: Understand tree terminology and master traversal methods (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, BFS) through node-pointer implementations.

**Binary Search Trees**: Leverage their O(log n) search properties through core insertion, deletion, and search operations.

**Heaps**: Grasp Min/Max-Heap fundamentals and their critical role in priority queue applications.

**Tries**: Explore prefix-based string storage powering autocomplete and dictionary systems.

**AVL Trees (Optional)**: After mastering other topics, learn self-balancing mechanisms and rotation operations that maintain optimal performance.

Master tree structures by visualizing before coding, leveraging recursion for traversals, prioritizing balance in BSTs/AVLs, and practicing heaps for priority-based solutions.

Stay consistent, and happy coding!
